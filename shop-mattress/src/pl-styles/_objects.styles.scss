/// ## Objects. 
/// 
/// Objects are class-based selectors. Their reach is narrower than that of base styles applied to primitives like `<h1>` and `<a>`, but it's still broader than that of components. All pages will likely have some object classes on them, where as a particular component will only be on specific pages. 
///
/// These classes are compiled before any component, page, or utility class, which means that object styles can be overridden if they are on the same element as a component, page, or utility class.
///
/// The naming convention is commonly driven by Object Oriented CSS principles (OCSS) and the styles themselves typically entail non-cosmetic design patterns.  
///
/// Example Object classes you might see are layout classes like `.section` or `.container`.  
///
/// Objects also include [grid](objects-grid.html) and [type](objects-typography.html) systems. 
/// @group objects-overview
